   <h4> 1.	What is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)?</h4>

   HTTP is a protocol which allows the fetching of resources, such as HTML documents.. 
<h4>
2.	Why is HTTP called a stateless protocol?
</h4>
HTTP is a stateless protocol because HTTP server needs not keep track of any state information. 
 <h4>
3.	Describe the three phases of establishing a session using client-server protocols such as HTTP.
</h4>
The three phases of establishing a session are: 
<ol>
    <li>
	The client establishes a connection. 
</li>
<li>
The client sends a request and waits for the answer.
</li>
<li>
The server accepts the request, providing status code and appropriate data.
</li>
</ol>
<h4>
4.	Describe the parameters on a get and post request.
</h4>
GET method is used to appends form data to the URL in name or value pair. <br>
Post method is used to send data to a server to create/change a resource. <br>
The main difference is GET is used for viewing something, without changing it, while POST is used for changing something.<br>
<h4>
5.	What are the HTTP response status code and What do the HTTP status codes, 200, and 404 indicate?
</h4>
HTTP response code displays the status of the HTTP request whether it is completed or not.  <br>
200	= Successful, 404 = file not found
<h4>
6.	What are HTTP cookies? Give an example.
</h4>
Http cookies are a piece of data that the sever sends to the user browser. For example, a web server might send a cookie containing the username that was last used to log into a website, so that it may be filled in automatically the next time the user logs in.
<h4>
7.	Why are cookies a security issue?
</h4>
Cookies have information stored in them, are visible to the user. That information can be hijacked by another user using third-party software if not careful. 
<h4>
8.	Describe session hijacking and XSS?
</h4>
Session hijacking is a method of taking over a web user session without the user notice obtaining the session ID and be disguised as something else. 
XSS is a common attack that injects malicious code into a vulnerable application which can hijack users top secret documents.
<h4>
9.	Describe Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)?
</h4>
CSRF is an attack on server that tricks the web browser into executing an unwanted action in an authorized application which causes data theft, stolen cookie.
<h4>
10.	What are Cross-site HTTP requests (CORS) and what requests use CORS?
</h4>
CORS is an HTTP based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any other origin other than its own from which its server should permit.The CORS mechanism supports secure cross-origin requests and data transfers between browsers and servers.<br>
